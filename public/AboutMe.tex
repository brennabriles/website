\maketitle

Brenna Briles is a 22 year old graduating senior at the University of
Texas at Austin. She was born in College Station, Texas and moved to
Austin for college. She is pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Arts in
Biology with minors in Sociology and Women and Gender Studies. After
graduation, she will be attending medical school in the fall of 2020.
She will be the first person in her family to earn a professional degree
and to become a physician. Brenna loves working with children and had
the opportunity to teach children about the environment as an animal
handler. During her undergraduate experience, she participated in
clinical research on pediatric traumatic brain injury, was a Child Life
volunteer at Dell Children's Medical Center, and volunteered at the
Central Texas Food Bank. Serving as a Child Life volunteer was her
favorite activity since she had the opportunity to relieve some of the
stress of living in a hospital for children with chronic illnesses. In
her free time, she enjoys hiking, swimming, and seeing the natural sites
abundant in Austin.
