<p>Brenna Briles is a 22 year old graduating senior at the University of Texas at Austin. She was born in College Station, Texas and moved to Austin for college. She is pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology with minors in Sociology and Women and Gender Studies. After graduation, she will be attending medical school in the fall of 2020. She will be the first person in her family to earn a professional degree and to become a physician. Brenna loves working with children and had the opportunity to teach children about the environment as an animal handler. During her undergraduate experience, she participated in clinical research on pediatric traumatic brain injury, was a Child Life volunteer at Dell Children’s Medical Center, and volunteered at the Central Texas Food Bank. Serving as a Child Life volunteer was her favorite activity since she had the opportunity to relieve some of the stress of living in a hospital for children with chronic illnesses. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, swimming, and seeing the natural sites abundant in Austin.</p>
